for the frontend part we are using  Svelte kit which is a framework for rapidly developing robust, performant web applications using Svelte. If you’re coming from React, SvelteKit is similar to Next. If you’re coming from Vue, SvelteKit is similar to Nuxt.

In short, Svelte is a way of writing user interface components — like a navigation bar, comment section, or contact form — that users see and interact with in their browsers. The Svelte compiler converts your components to JavaScript that can be run to render the HTML for the page and to CSS that styles the page
